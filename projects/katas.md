# Katas Check List

  - Unless the team decides, the kata should be done right after the stand-up
  - Share both katas in Slack and raise awareness in the group that they should start the kata
  - It should not take more the 1 hour overall
    - 45 min to do the kata
    - 15 min to review the kata
  - Make sure that everyone knows until what time they can do the kata
  - Go around and make sure that everyone is dedicating time to do the kata
  - We cannot force them to do the kata but we can try to convince them
    - It's useful to start the brain in the morning
    - It's possible that companies will ask you in the interview
    - It allows you to disconnect for a while from the project
  - If they refuse to do the kata, no help will be provided until after the review
